# FTL-Scoring

FTL is a game that me and my friends have been playing for 2 years in our closed football group.
It is based on Premier leagus matches, much like FPL with some tweaks in the rules, this repo will help us in calculating score.

Previously calculating scores manually used to take 45 min to 1 hour of a person's time, A person used to check scores of 10 different teams of 11 players + 1 manager. Now with this, it'd take less than 5 minutes.
